## How to Use

> On the home page there is blank screen and a sidebar which contains three elements - label, input and button

> User can drag these elements and drop it onto the screen

> On dropping the elements a new element is created and added to the screen

> On dopping the elements on the screen, a modal appears for configuration. The modal auto-fills X and Y coordinates based on the drop location.
Saving the configuration places the component on the page.

> Users can drag the elements to change their positions.
Clicking a element selects it and shows a red border.

> Pressing Enter on a selected element reopens the configuration modal.

> Pressing Delete on a selected element removes it from the page.

> All changes (add/update/delete/move) are automatically saved to local storage.

> Users can export the current page configuration to a JSON file for sharing or backup.
